# Welcome to AnalyticsLol
A student project made by [Jager Noe](https://elnukakujo.github.io/) and [Berete Mohamed](https://mohamed-loua.github.io/), two master students at University of Montr√©al.
We are proud to present here our 2024 summer project which is a statistic website for players of League of Legends, a free to play Multiplayer online battle arena, and Action role-playing game.
(see [here](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/)).


We are using Javascript and React for the front development and C# with Dotnet for the back development. This is just a fun student project and so non monetized.
